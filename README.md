# etl_weather 

## Description 
This project implements an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow and Astro. It is designed to process weather data, although specific details about the data source, transformations, and loading destination are not available in the provided context. The pipeline automates the process of extracting data, transforming it into a usable format, and loading it into a data warehouse or data lake for analysis.

## Features 
*   End-to-End ETL Pipeline: Orchestrates the complete data processing workflow.
*   Airflow Integration: Uses Apache Airflow for scheduling and monitoring the pipeline.
*   Astro Integration: Leverages Astro (presumably Astro SDK or a similar tool) to simplify Airflow DAG development. More information about astro needed
*   Automated Data Processing: Automates the extraction, transformation, and loading of data.

## Tech Stack 
*   Apache Airflow: Workflow management platform.
*   Astro: Framework/SDK for simplifying Airflow DAGs.
*   Programming Language: (Inferred) Python (due to Airflow and Astro usage).

## Installation 
Detailed installation instructions cannot be provided without specific dependencies or configuration files. However, a general guide is given below:

1.  **Install Apache Airflow:**

    ```bash
    pip install apache-airflow
    ```
    Follow the official Airflow documentation for detailed installation instructions and setup.

2.  **Install Astro:**

    ```bash
    pip install astro-sdk
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    pip install astro-cli
    ```
    Refer to Astro's documentation for specific installation guides.

3.  **Install any additional dependencies**
    *If any dependency file is available in the project, install the required dependencies using that file*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 
1.  **Configure Airflow:**
    *   Set up the Airflow environment, including defining connections to data sources and destinations.
2.  **Create Airflow DAGs:**
    *   Define the ETL pipeline using Airflow DAGs, leveraging Astro for simplified task creation.
3.  **Trigger the DAG:**
    *   Run the Airflow DAG to execute the ETL pipeline.
4.  **Real-world use case**
    This ETL pipeline can be used to ingest weather data from various sources (e.g., APIs, databases), transform the data by cleaning, aggregating, or enriching it, and load it into a data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery) or data lake (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage) for analytical purposes, reporting, and further analysis.

## Project Structure 📂
Given the limited context, a detailed project structure cannot be accurately determined. A typical structure for Airflow projects might look like this:

```
